//Using java, come up with a small program which has an algorithm that
//computes the bonus rewards for a sportpesa jackpot. Let your program pick
// input from the user and then awards a cash bonus for 10, 11, and 12 correct
//predictions. For 13 correct predictions, your algorithm should inform the user
//that the jackpot has been won, and it should then generate a new value for the
//jackpot.

//Extra tips : Enjoy :-)
